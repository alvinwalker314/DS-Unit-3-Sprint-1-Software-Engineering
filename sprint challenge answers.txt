Sprint Questions: 
What, in your opinion, is an important part of code reviews? That is, what is something you pay attention to when you review code, 
and that you appreciate when others do the same for your code?
I feel giving feedback is an important part of code reviews. Usually there is always a spot in the code that can be improved and it's up to the reviewer to find it and 
help the one being reviewed make it better. I like when people offer suggestions to my code. For example, if i have line of code repeated, I want them to remind me i can place it
in a function. 

We have an awful lot of computers here, and it gets pretty confusing with slightly different things running on all of them. How could containers help us improve this situation?
Containers allow anyone with that container to run your packages on your computer. It has all the requirement/dependancies built in. It solves the issue of not having certain 
requirements like a package, operating system, etc.
